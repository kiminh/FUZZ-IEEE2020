## Abstract
We introduce "fuzzy Challenge Response Framework" (fChRF) as a formal model for understanding of relationship between a model (usually computed) and real world observations. Both real and model situations consist of challenges/questions and responses/answers. We introduce a class of "scaled fuzzy Implicators" (sfI) to measure the quality of reduction of real world situations to model situations. 

In this paper, we test these formal concepts in a recommender systems  use-case. A recommender algorithm (trained off-line with a metric) aims to provide users with relevant objects. Observations consist of user behavior in such recommended on-line scenario. 

Using fChRF and fsI we measure which recommender and which off-line metric is the most promising help with respect to user behavior evaluated with several on-line measures. We present results on a real world small e-commerce enterprise A/B testing data.
